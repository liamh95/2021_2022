	\item An urn contains $n$ red balls and $m$ blue balls. They are withdrawn one at a time until a total of $r$ red balls have been withdrawn (here $r\leq n$). Find the probability that a total of $k$ balls are withdrawn.
	\textit{Hint: if $k$ balls are withdrawn in total, what color is the last ball? How many of each color are there in the other $k-1$ withdrawn balls?}
	\vfill

	\item Let $X$ be a continuous random variable having cumulative distribution function $F$. Define the random variable $Y$ by $Y = F(X)$. Show that $Y$ is uniformly distributed over $(0,1)$.
	\textit{Hint: what is the cumulative distribution function for $Y$? You can assume that $F$ is invertible.}
