	\item You run a whale-watching business in San Diego.
	Every day you are unable to operate your tour due to bad weather with probability $p$, independently of all other days.
	You work every day except the bad-weather days.

	Let $Y$ be the number of consecutive days you work between bad-weather days and let $X$ be the total number of customers who attend your tour in this period of $Y$ days.
	Conditional on $Y$, suppose the distribution of $X$ is
	\[
		X\mid Y \sim \text{Pois}(\mu Y).
	\]
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What kind of random variable is $Y$. What are its expectation and variance?
		\vfill

		\item Find the expectation and variance of the number of customers you see between bad weather days.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item A factory has produced $n$ robots, each of which is faulty with probability $\phi$. Each robot is tested to determine whether or not it is faulty. If the robot it faulty, the test detects the fault with probability $\delta$. Let $X$ be the number of faulty robots, and let $Y$ be the number detected as faulty. Under normal assumptions about dependence, show that
	\[
		\E[X\mid Y] = \frac{n\phi(1-\delta) + (1-\phi)Y}{1-\phi\delta}.
	\]

	\item Suppose that a statistician determines that the revenue the biological sciences Starbucks makes in a week is a random variable, $X$, with moment generating function
	\[
		m_X(t) = \frac{1}{(1-2500t)^4}.
	\]
	Find the standard deviation of the revenue the Starbucks makes in a week.

	\vfill

	\item Let $X$ and $Y$ be two independent random variables with respective moment generating functions
	\[
		m_X(t) = \frac{1}{1-5t},\ \text{if }t<1/5,\quad m_Y(t) = \frac{1}{(1-5t)^2},\ \text{if }t<1/5.
	\]
	Find $\E[(X+Y)^2]$.

	\vfill

	\item True or False? If $X$ and $Y$ are independent exponential random variables with parameters $\lambda_x$ and $\lambda_y$, respectively, then $X+Y$ is an exponential random variable with parameter $\lambda_x + \lambda_y$.
